I think of myself as a “fixer”. Someone who gets the work done and provides the push to get it over the line. I like to read and learn new things and would count it as one of my greatest strengths.

Pursuing graduate studies in Electrical and Computer engineering is a big leap of faith in my abilities to transform my hard work and efforts into something fruitful. I believe in working for the team and with the team. At Purdue University, I am part of the Internet Systems Lab and my advisor is Prof. Sanjay Rao. I work on Data Driven Network Optimisation, currently focussing on improving video streaming experience. I graduated from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus in 2016 as a topper in Electrical & Electronics Engineering. The college life was one of the most productive phases where in I got chance to be a part of wonderful projects and groups. It allowed me to work with excellent professors as well as do industrial internships providing me with best of both the worlds: industry and academia. After graduation, I worked at Cisco Systems India under the mentorship of Bibhuti Kar and Ranjiith Selvarajan, my managers at Cisco. I was part of Content Security team and helped in its migration to cloud. I got a chance to familiarize myself with various industrial practices and enrich my industrial work experience.
