I am a PhD student (2018-) at Purdue University where I am advised by Prof. Sanjay Rao. Earlier, I worked as an engineer at Cisco (2016-2018). I earned my Bachelors from BITS Pilani (2012-2016). At Cisco, I worked on Email and Web security products. It has been my great fortune to have worked with excellent mentors and advisors.

My current research lies at the intesection of machine-learning and computer networks. Specifically, I am interested in understanding causality in network layers and applications. In the past, I have worked on developing high perceptual quality 360 video streaming system and adaptive bitrate algorithms for video streaming.
